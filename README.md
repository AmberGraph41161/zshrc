# personal zshrc as of Tuesday, June 11, 2024, 22:16:10

didn't bother to read to plugins files to make sure they were safe. use at own risk

will probably read and make sure plugins are safe to use out of paranoia "soon"




added some bling to my prompt. Can tell the difference between TTY and gui terminal which is nice now



as of Monday, June 10, 2024, 00:44:32, I am still too stupid and lazy to learn github cli...
the gui file uploader won't let me include hidden directories....
so just gonna upload .zshrc without the plugins folder...
stupid
